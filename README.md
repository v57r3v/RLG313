RLG313: Love, Sex, Family
Winter 2025
Course Description:
This   course   will   explore   the   multiple   and   shifting   intersections   between   religion,on   the   one   hand,and   love, sex,and   family,on   the   other.We   will   pay   close   attention   to   the   way   religions   construct,control,and   shape   these social formations   in the Americas from the   nineteenth   through   to   the   twenty-first   centuries.We   will   use   case   studies   to   inform   our   analysis(e.g.,the   Moral   Majority   and   the   overturning   of   Roe   v.Wade;Mormon      polygamy;sex   workers   in   Mennonite   country;and   Pope   Francis'declaration   of   human-animal   kinship   as "selfish").We   will   also   attend   to   the   long   reach   of   traditional   notions   of   love,sex,and   family   and   their "translation"into       secularized       forms(e.g.,media,entertainment,popular culture)for contemporary life.By analyzing   a   variety   of   different   romantic   and   kinship   arrangements,this   course   will   help   make   clear   the contingency,constructedness,and   historical   development   of   these   notions,however   natural   or   inevitable   they   may   seem.
Learning   Outcomes:

·             think   critically   about   how   these   religious   roots   and   their   modern   formations   are   used,perpetuated,   and      transformed in different legal,cultural,political,relational,and      ethical contexts

代做程序编程语言the   form   of   in-class   discussions,group work,and writing   activities,all   of which will   be   based   on   the   assigned   readings   and lecture   materials.I   understand   that   our   class   time   is   limited   and   it   will   not   always   be   possible   for   all   voices   to   be   heard,so   there   will   be   an   additional   opportunity   to   share   your   thoughts   with   your   classmates   on   a   discussion board that   will   be   open   for   48   hours after class.I will   post   questions   that   can   betaken   up and/or   students   can   raise   their   own   questions,comments,and   reflections   that   emerge   from   the week's   materials.
Reflections
1-Family       Types       Terms
This   reflection(350-500   words)asks students to briefly   describe three different types of families   (e.g.,   intergenerational,nuclear,the      Addams      Family)or      to   define   three   family   related   terms(e.g.,marriage, divorce,mother,sister).Please   make   these   as   different   as   you   can   manage   and   write   one   paragraph   per      family   type/term.These   families    might be real or   fictional,from   any   time    period,families   you    personally know   (including   your   own),or families   that   you've   encountered   in   books   or films.The   terms   can   reflect   your   own    experiences,propose    alternative/creative/fantastical    definitions,or respond critically to the biases, power   dynamics,and/or   social   constructions   of   more   traditional   terms.No   citations   or   bibliography   are required.
2-Readings
This    reflection(500-750    words)asks students to   choose a set of readings and the   primary   materials
(text,image,video,etc.)discu   ssed   in   one   week of the course and write a critical   response to   the
themes,questions,and   points   of discussion that   come   out   of these texts.The   goal   is   to   critically   engage   the   ideas   and   offer   your   own   perspectives   rather   than   summarizing   the   readings.References   are   not   included   in the   word   count.
In   both   cases,these   are   not   formal   essays:rather   they   are   intended   to   help   hone   your   ability   to   think   critically   and   in   a   focused   way.
Family Tree
Create a family tree. You can draw or use photos, stock images,illustrations,maps,collaging,and/or
digital   visualization   tools,such   as   Canva,etc.to   do   so.The   goal   is   to   visually   explore   the   people   you   are   connected   to   and   how   you   relate   to   them.This   can   be   biological   and/or   chosen   family,or   any   other   form. of   kinship relation   you can   think    of(e.g.,pets,food,work,natural    environments).Feel   free   to be creative and   use   as   much   or   as   lile   information   as   you   feel   comfortable   with.Anonymizing   or   using   pseudonyms   to   protect   this   data   is   welcome   and   encouraged.
Then,write   a   positionality   paper   (700-1000   words)on   what   you   learned   about   yourself   and   these relations.What   kinds   of   family   structures   are   you   or   they   a   part   of?How   does/doesn't   religion   factor   into   these family stories and   relationships?Use at   least one   of the   course   readings   to   support your   discussion.         Some   research   may   be   required   (e.g.,interviewing   family   members,the   history   of   a   nation,religious,or ethnic   group).You   might   also   find   it   useful   to   build   on   the   ideas   explored   in   the   first   reflection   paper   in   this   essay.
Final   Essay or Take-Home   Exam
The last assignment is   your   choice   of   a   final   essay(1800-2300   words)or   a   take-home   exam(1800-2300   words).   Students will   commit to either   writing   an   essay   or the   take-home   exam   by   an   email   sent   to   the   instructor(and   cc'ing   both   TAs)by April   9   at   noon.   Those   writing   a   final   paper   are   free   to   choose   the   topic   of the   final   essay,as   long   as   it   fits   into   the   general   themes   of the   class.They   must   include   a   bibliography with   at   least four   sources,including   two from   our   class.Take-home   exams will   be   based   directly   on   class   readings   and   discussions   and   do   not   require   additional   research.   Students will   have 72   hours to   complete the take-home   exam.
